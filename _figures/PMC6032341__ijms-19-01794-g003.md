caption: Potential action mechanism of RANBP9 in ATM-dependent DDR. In RANBP9 (red)
  expressing cells and in the absence of DNA damage (left panel, top), RANBP9 protein
  shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Upon DNA damage such as IR and DNA-damaging
  drugs (left panel, bottom), ATM is activated and enhances RANBP9 nuclear accumulation
  through its phosphorylation, potentially with other cytoplasmic partners (purple).
  This event potentially leads to enhanced KAT5-dependent ATM acetylation, a marker
  of its full activation. For this reason, RANBP9-expressing cells activate an efficient
  ATM signaling pathway, resulting in efficient DNA repair and survival to genotoxic
  stress. Conversely, when RANBP9 expression is reduced, the full activation of ATM
  is impaired, leading to inefficient DNA repair and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.
