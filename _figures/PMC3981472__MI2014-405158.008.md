caption: In summary, lancemaside A was able to suppress various inflammatory responses
  that are managed by macrophages and monocytes. This compound inhibited the release
  of NO, the expression of iNOS, the upregulation of CD80, the induction of morphological
  changes, and the increases in phagocytic activity, ROS generation, and cell-cell
  and cell-FN adhesion by suppressing the activity of IKK and p65/NF-κB, as summarized
  in . Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory mechanism
  of lancemaside A involves the suppression of the cellular responses of macrophages
  and monocytes by blocking redox activation and the IKK/NF-κB pathway. Based on our
  data and previous reports, we also propose that lancemaside A can be further developed
  as the first anti-inflammatory drug prepared from Codonopsis lanceolata. Therefore,
  our future studies will focus on examining this possibility.
