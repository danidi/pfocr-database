caption: 'Ribosomal subunit assembly pathway in S. cerevisiae. In the nucleolus, the
  35S pre-rRNA associates with many early-associating 40S and 60S r-proteins to form
  a 90S preribosome. The 5S rRNA forms a stable RNP with Rpl5p (L5, red dot). The
  5S rRNA is probably already present in 90S preribosomes; therefore, Rpl5p may belong
  to the group of early-assembling 60S r-proteins. From the 90S particle, 66S and
  43S preribosomes containing the 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs, respectively, are formed.
  The 66S and the 43S preribosomes contain the late-associating r-proteins. Preribosomes
  are most likely actively exported through nuclear pores. It has been demonstrated
  that export of 60S ribosomal subunits requires the nuclear or cytoplasmic Ran cycle
  and distinct nucleoporins (not shown; for details, see reference ). It is believed
  that the 66S particle remains in the nucleus until the 7S pre-rRNA is processed
  to the mature 5.8S rRNA, while the 43S preribosome is rapidly exported to the cytoplasm,
  where the final maturation step in the synthesis of the 18S rRNA takes place. Assembly
  of 60S ribosomal subunits is also completed in the cytoplasm by the final incorporation
  of some r-proteins. At least three of them (also depicted as red dots), including
  the P2B and Rpl10p/Qsr1p (L10) r-proteins, can exchange on mature 60S ribosomal
  subunits in vivo. Preribosomes are drawn as balloons, and the nuclear envelope is
  depicted as pink rods. Protein trans-acting factors with likely involvement in the
  assembly of ribosomal subunits are colored as follows: red, putative ATP-dependent
  RNA helicases; black, others. Only those r-proteins for which an indication about
  the timing of their association with preribosomal particles is known are shown.
