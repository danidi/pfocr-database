caption: The leptin/melanocortin pathway. POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus are
  activated by leptin and produce the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which
  then activates the MC4R receptor in the paraventricular nucleus resulting in a satiety
  signal. A separate group of neurons expressing NPY and AGRP produce molecules that
  act as potent inhibitors of MC4R signaling. The downstream roles of SIM1, BDNF,
  and TKRB are currently being explored. AGRP = agouti-related protein; BDNF = brain-derived
  neurotropic factor; LEPR = leptin receptor; NPY = neuropeptide Y; POMC = proopiomelanocortin;
  SIM1 = single-minded 1; TRKB = tyrosine kinase receptor.
