caption: Model for membrane fusion-induced host cell signaling. The reciprocal relationship
  between AKT1 and the ERK/MAPK pathway during HNFV-HepG2 cell fusion is simplified
  in this schematic model. The impairment of AKT activation by HN protein contact
  with target cells (through terminal sialic acid [TSA] receptors of HepG2 cells)
  prevents the phosphorylation of F protein and allows complete fusion (hemifusion
  and core mixing) catalyzed by F protein (with F bound to ASGPR of HepG2 cells).
  Meanwhile, stress during the hemifusion state (lipid mixing) induces the ERK/MAPK
  pathway through ceramide synthesis, which in turn supports membrane fusion through
  ezrin-induced actin depolymerization. Ceramide-activated PP2A seems to lie at the
  crossing of two opposing pathways, with one supporting the fusion event (Raf/ERK/MAPK)
  and the other inhibiting it (AKT).
