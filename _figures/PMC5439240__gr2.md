caption: Paracellular intestinal barrier in health and inflammation. The paracellular
  barrier in healthy distal intestinal tissue is characterized by high expression
  levels of barrier-forming TJ proteins, which leads to a low paracellular permeability.
  In inflammation, the TJ barrier is disturbed. Channel-forming claudins are up-regulated
  in their expression (eg, by TNF-α or IL13), leading to an increased permeability
  for ions and water (pore pathway). Barrier-forming TJ proteins are down-regulated
  and can also be shifted into subjunctional regions or into endosomes, which further
  destabilizes the TJ barrier. Occludin, which is, besides tricellulin, involved in
  regulation of permeability for macromolecules, is also down-regulated by inflammatory
  processes (eg, by TNF-α or interferon-γ), leading to increased paracellular permeability
  for macromolecules (leak-pathway). IFN, interferon.
