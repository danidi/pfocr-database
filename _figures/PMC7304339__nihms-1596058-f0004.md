caption: Of the nearly 200 clinical trials underway evaluating immunotherapy in head
  and neck cancer, the vast majority include combinations of therapy. Larger colored
  circles represent major treatment modalities in head and neck cancer. Smaller black
  circles at the nexus of multiple treatment modalities represent a unique combination
  treatment strategy under clinical trial evaluation. Numbers within the small black
  circles correspond to the numbers listed in the leftmost column of , where NCT numbers
  of active clinical trials (as of November 1, 2018) are listed. For example, number
  45 in the upper left-most small black circle indicates the combination of CTLA-4
  blockade with radiation and targeted chemotherapy and row 45 of  lists the corresponding
  clinical trials. ACT, Adoptive cell transfer; Alt CP, alternative checkpoint molecule;
  Chemo, chemotherapy; Co-stim, co-stimulatory pathway agonist; CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen 4; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; Novel, novel immunologic
  treatment strategy; PD-1, programmed death 1; Targeted, target molecular therapy
  such as an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage;
  Treg, regulatory T cell.
