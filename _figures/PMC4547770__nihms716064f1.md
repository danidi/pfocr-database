caption: 'Metabolic pathway for DEG based on previous animal studies and on the results
  presented in this report. Metabolites in lined boxes have been observed following
  administration of DEG to animals; those in dashed boxes are theoretical intermediates.
  Because fomepizole reduced the amount of EG in the urine, its origin is shown as
  coming from the aldehyde or acid intermediate, rather than from DEG itself. ALDH,
  aldehyde dehydrogenase. DGA is also known as oxybisacetic acid. Reprinted with permission
