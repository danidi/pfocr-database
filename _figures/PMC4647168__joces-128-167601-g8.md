caption: RhoC maintains vascular homeostasis through regulation of endothelial VEGF
  signaling. VEGF signals through VEGFR-2 to activate the GTP-bound form of RhoC.
  Active RhoC promotes nuclear stabilization of β-catenin, which acts as a transcription
  factor to increase the expression of cyclin D1, drive cell cycle progression, and
  stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. RhoC negatively regulates VEGF-induced
  vascular permeability by decreasing phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and phosphorylation
  of eNOS (peNOS) to reduce intracellular cellular Ca2+ release. Stress-induced protein
  kinase p38 MAPKs are also downregulated by RhoC. Endothelial cell migration is negatively
  controlled by RhoC through a decreased activation of the Ras–Raf–MEK–MAPK signaling
  pathway. Specifically, RhoC reduces phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs and ERK1/2 along
  with that of downstream MLC2 to negatively modulate endothelial cell proliferation.
  Our data suggests RhoC regulates the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2.
