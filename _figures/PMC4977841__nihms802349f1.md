caption: 'A: In the absence of ligand, the transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptch) normally
  inhibits the signaling function of another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo),
  thereby blocking the expression of target genes. In that inactive situation, Suppressor
  of Fused (SuFu) prevents Gli from translocating to the nucleus.B: In the presence
  of the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), the repression of Smo is relieved after binding
  of Shh to Ptch. Smo further transduces a signal resulting in the release of transcription
  factor Gli from the cytoplasmic proteins Fused (Fu) and SuFu. In the active situation
  SuFu is inhibited by Fu and Gli is released, translocates to the nucleus and activates
  target genes transcription, such as Ptch and Gli1.'
