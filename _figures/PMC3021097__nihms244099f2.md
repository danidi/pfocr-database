caption: 'Functional significance of itpkc_3 on ITPKC mRNA and Ca2+/NFAT pathway.
  (A) Effect of itpkc_3 C allele on splicing of ITPKC pre mRNA. The C allele of itpkc_3
  reduces splicing efficiency of IPTKC premRNA. mRNAs harboring unspliced intron 1
  cannot be translated properly and will be degraded early by nonsense-mediated decay
  mechanism. (B) Proposed role of ITPKC as a negative regulator of Ca2+/NFAT pathway.
  When the T-cell receptor (TCR) is bound by antigen/MHC complex on antigen presenting
  cells (APCs), adaptor molecules and kinases are recruited and phospholipse C-γ1
  (PLC-γ1) is activated by phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue. IP3 and diacylglycerol
  (DAG), another second messenger molecule, are generated by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) by activated PLC-γ1. IP3 binds to its receptor expressed
  on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and causes the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm.
  Then depletion of Ca2+ store in ER evokes a process termed as store operated Ca2+
  entry in which extracellular Ca2+ enters through calcium release-activated Ca2+
  channels on the plasma membrane. Recent advances in research identified the role
  of stromal interaction molecule (STIM) as a sensor of Ca2+ in ER and ORAI as a calcium
  release-activated Ca2+ channel. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ binds calmodulin, which in turn
  activates calcineurin, a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Activated calcineurin
  dephosphorylate NFAT in the cytoplasm and lead nuclear translocation of NFAT. NFAT
  in the nucleus drives transcription of genes important in T cell activation as a
  homodimer or heterodimer with other transcription factors. AP1 is one of the transcription
  partners of NFAT, which is activated by a signal from TCR mediated by DAG (72–74).
  Reactions and amounts of molecules increased by the effect of itpkc_3 C alleles
  were represented by red characters and arrows and those reduced by blue, respectively.
