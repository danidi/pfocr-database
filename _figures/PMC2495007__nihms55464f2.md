caption: Inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα and LPS activates the kinase IKKα, which
  then translocates into the nucleus where it binds to PIAS1 and then phosphorylates
  PIAS1 on Ser90 residue. The IKKα-mediated PIAS1 phosphorylation is dependent on
  the SUMO E3 ligase activity of PIAS1, suggesting the possible sumoylation (Su?)
  of PIAS1 and/or IKKα during this process. Phosphorylated PIAS1 disassociates from
  IKKα, and is then recruited to the promoters of PIAS1-responsive genes for transcriptional
  repression.
