caption: 'The Base Excision Repair Pathway. BER consists of 5 stages: Damaged bases
  are recognised and removed by BER glycolases to produce an abasic intermediate.
  BER endonucleases (commonly APE1) make a site incision, generating a SSB. The sugar
  backbone is modified by phosphodiesterase. The newly formed nucleotide gap is filled
  by DNA polymerase. DNA ligase seals the nucleotide patch together. In SP-BER DNA
  polymerase B (Pol β) replaces the damaged nucleotide and the ends are ligated by
  DNA Lig III []. In LP-BER the patch is processed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen
  (PCNA), 9–1-1 complex and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), the nucleotides replaced by
  Pol δ and Pol ε with ligation by Lig I. in the single strand break repair (SSBR)
  pathway, PARP1 senses nicks in DNA, recruits XRCC1which acts as a scaffold for the
  other BER components to stabilise the SSB'
