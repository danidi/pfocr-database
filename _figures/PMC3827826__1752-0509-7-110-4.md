caption: Clustered view of pathways involved in AKI. A summarised overview of signalling
  cascades triggered by AKI leading ultimately to apoptosis and necrosis is shown.
  Based on the bioinformatics approach the Angiotensin-Aldosterone system, ROS, NFκB,
  glutamatergic signalling and cell death appear to be key targets for therapeutic
  intervention. Of these, ROS targeting approaches have failed to date and efforts
  should concentrate in selective ROS targeting. In this respect recent successful
  attempts have focused on mitochondrial ROS targeting. There is also evidence that
  targeting cell death and NFκB might be beneficial, although the complexity of the
  NFκB system requires exploration of more selective approaches. By contrast the role
  of glutamatergic signalling in AKI remains largely unexplored. The initial entry-point
  was selected by activating the RAAS axis, though it is known that different AKI-conditions
  can have other starting points within and outside the sequence of events depicted.
  Since pathway names can be ambiguous, the proteins involved and found in the most
  significant dataset of 1480 entries are listed as well. The protein coloration ranges
  from green (down-regulated) to red (up-regulated). Pathway names in green are evoked
  after transcriptional and translational events.
