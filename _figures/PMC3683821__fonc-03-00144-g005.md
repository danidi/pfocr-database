caption: Proposed effects of UVB and caffeine on the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1 pathway and
  premature mitosis. The signal that DNA synthesis is not complete (and that chromatin
  condensation and mitosis should not start) after UVB irradiation is sent by ATR
  after it is recruited to stalled replication forks that have been coated by replication
  protein A. ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 after UVB irradiation results in
  a decreased level and function of cyclin B1, which delays mitotic entry and prevents
  premature chromatin condensation and mitosis. Inhibition of the ATR/Chk1 pathway
  in UVB-treated cells should result in a premature increase in cyclin B1 and premature
  chromatin condensation, mitosis, and cell death, probably by mitotic catastrophe
  followed by apoptosis, as suggested by Brown and Attardi (). Adapted with permission
