caption: Biosynthesis of rhamnolipids, highlighting the proposed contributions of
  de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation to the fatty acids incorporated
  into rhamnolipids. (A) Normally, in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, the initial
  four-carbon β-ketoacyl-ACP is formed from the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP.
  This reaction is catalyzed by FabH. Thereafter, the fatty acid is elongated in a
  cyclic fashion, each cycle adding two carbons [R(n+2), R(n+4), R(n+6), etc.], by
  the condensation of acyl-ACP (shown as Rn acyl-ACP) with malonyl-ACP [intermediates
  shown as R(n+2)]. We propose that when a fatty acid is added as a cosubstrate, the
  β-ketoacyl-ACP can also be formed from a bypass route linking the β-oxidation pathway
  with the de novo fatty acid pathway, likely catalyzed by a FabH-like enzyme. Specifically,
  the acyl-CoA β-oxidation intermediate, in particular the C8-acyl-CoA, condenses
  with malonyl-ACP to form the C10-β-ketoacyl-ACP, which is then recruited by RhlA
  to form HAA. The dashed arrow indicates the proposed bypass route for recruiting
  fatty acids from β-oxidation for rhamnolipid biosynthesis. (B) Structures of HAA,
  monorhamnolipid, and dirhamnolipid.
