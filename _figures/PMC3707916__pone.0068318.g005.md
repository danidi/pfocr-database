caption: 'Host proteins that were found to be significantly differentially regulated

  were altered during the course of WNV-infection in the mice brain, including: (A)

  signaling. (B) The perturbations of the protein ubiquitination pathway allowing

  of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway corresponding to an evasion mechanism against
  activation of the antiviral response. (D) The kinetic modulation of the inflammatory
  response leading to brain injuries. (E) Cell death comprising neuronal necrosis
  and apoptotic phenomena. (F) The brain damage reflected by the abundance variation
  of numerous proteins involved in the deterioration of neurological functions. Known
