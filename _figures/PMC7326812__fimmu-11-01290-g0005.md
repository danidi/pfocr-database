caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). The diagram depicts biological networks
  of genes whose expression was ≥2-fold (shown in color) in the AMs of SP-A2 (1A0)
  males vs. females at the 6 h post-infection time point. The diagram shows reported
  direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines) interactions for these genes. (Left)
  genes and pathways in male mice; (Right) genes and pathways in female mice. Each
  gene or group of genes is represented as a node. Molecules that are significantly
  altered ≥2 are represented as node in red. Node shapes represent functional classes
  of gene products: Square for cytokines, Concentric (double) circle for complex/group,
  Diamonds for enzymes and peptidases, Ovals for transcription regulators and transmembrane
  receptors, Triangle for phosphatases and kinases, Rectangles for ligand-dependent
  nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and ion channels, Trapezoids for
  transporters and microRNAs.'
