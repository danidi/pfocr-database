caption: Illustration of some of the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of methotrexate
  (MTX). MTX is transported into the cell via the solute carrier family 19, member
  1 (SLC19A1). It can be actively transported out of the cell by the ATP-binding cassette
  transporters including ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (CFTR/MRP), member 1–4
  (ABCC1-C4) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2). Within the cell
  it undergoes polyglutamation (activation) under the enzymic control of folylpolyglutamate
  synthase (FPGS). This is a dynamic process where glutamate residues can be removed
  by gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH). In the polyglutamated form MTX inhibits aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC), which probably accounts for some of its anti-inflammatory
  effects via an intracellular rise in adenosine. Inhibition of the folate pathway
  may not be as important to its mechanism of action in psoriasis, but this pathway
  includes the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) which has been
  subject to a number of MTX pharmacogenetic studies in the past. MTHFR catalyses
  the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 5,10-CH2-THF to 5-methyltetrahydofolate
  (5-CH3-THF), which is a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation. The polyglutamated
  form of MTX also inhibits thymidylate synthase (TYMS), which converts deoxyuridylate
  (dUMP) to deoxythymidylate (dTMP) in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.
  Genes chosen for this investigation are highlighted in red.
