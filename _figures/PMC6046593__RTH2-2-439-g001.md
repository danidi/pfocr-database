caption: 'Platelet function and molecular targets of antiplatelet agents. Initial
  platelet adhesion to damaged vessel walls is mediated by the binding of exposed
  collagen to platelet surface glycoprotein (GP) VI and integrin α2β1 and by the binding
  of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet surface GPIb‐IX‐V complex. This complex
  is also a receptor for other platelet ligands (thrombospondin, collagen and P‐selectin),
  leukocyte integrin αMβ2, and procoagulant factors (thrombin, kininogen, factor XI
  and factor XII). Thrombin, generated by the coagulation cascade, is a potent activator
  of human platelets through two platelet surface receptors: protease‐activated receptor
  (PAR)‐1 and PAR‐4. Three groups of platelet surface receptors provide important
  positive feedback loops for platelet activation: P2Y1 and P2Y12 are stimulated by
  ADP released from platelet dense granules; 5‐hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors (5HT2A)
  are stimulated by 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT; also known as serotonin) released from
  platelet dense granules; and the thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor is stimulated
  by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generated by the platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)‐1‐dependent
  signaling pathway. Platelet‐to‐platelet aggregation is mediated by fibrinogen and,
  at high shear flow, by VWF binding to activated integrin αIIbβ3. Perpetuation of
  platelet‐to‐platelet aggregation is augmented by other receptors, including junctional
  adhesion molecule A (JAMA) and JAMC, growth‐arrest specific gene 6 receptor, and
  ephrin. Platelet‐monocyte adhesion is initially mediated by the binding of platelet
  surface P‐selectin to its constitutively expressed cognate receptor, P‐selectin
  glycoprotein ligand‐1 (PSGL‐1), on the monocyte surface. Activated platelets, monocytes
  and microparticles bind coagulation factors and provide a surface for the generation
  of a fibrin clot. Approved antiplatelet agents and their molecular targets are shown
  in boxes. Indirect inhibitors (unfractionated heparin [UFH], low‐molecular‐weight
  heparin [LMWH]) and direct inhibitors (lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin and dabigatran)
  of thrombin, unlike PAR‐1 antagonists, are anticoagulants rather than specific antiplatelet
  drugs. However, their inhibition of thrombin results in reduced platelet activation.
  Investigational strategies for novel antiplatelet agents are shown by the symbols
  adjacent to: GPIb‐IX‐V, GPVI, α2β1, EP3, 5HT2A, PAR‐4, P2Y1, P2Y12, PSGL1, PI3Kβ,
  αIIbβ3 and the TP receptor. AA, arachidonic acid; EP3, prostaglandin E2 receptor
  EP3 subtype; NO, nitric oxide; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PG, prostaglandin; PI3Kβ,
  phosphoinositide 3‐kinase β‐isoform. Modified from Michelson AD. Nat Rev Drug Discov.
