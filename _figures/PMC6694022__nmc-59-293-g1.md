caption: MGMT demethylation is a known factor in the resistance of temozolomide (TMZ),
  which is the mainstream drug. The PARP1–PARP binding protein (PARPBP) complex also
  contributes to TMZ resistance by the BER pathway. Depletion of RET finger protein
  (RFP) decreases the transcription of PARPBP, and destroys the formation of complex,
  leading to cytotoxicity.
