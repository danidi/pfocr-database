caption: 'Mechanism of ADE and antibody mediated immunopathology. Left panel: For
  ADE, immune complex internalization is mediated by the engagement of activating
  Fc receptors on the cell surface. Co-ligation of inhibitory receptors then results
  in the inhibition of antiviral responses which leads to increased viral replication.
  Right panel: Antibodies can cause immunopathology by activating the complement pathway
  or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). For both pathways, excessive
  immune activation results in the release of cytokines and chemokines, leading to
  enhanced disease pathology.'
