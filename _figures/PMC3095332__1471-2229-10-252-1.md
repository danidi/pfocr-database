caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway from tyrosine to sanguinarine. Biosynthesis of sanguinarine
  from tyrosine. Enzymes for which cognate cDNAs have been isolated are shown in black.
  Abbreviations: TYDC, tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase; NCS, norcoclaurine synthase; 6OMT,
  (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, (S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase;
  NMCH, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3''-hydroxylase; 4''OMT, (S)-3''-hdroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4''-O-methyltransferase; BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; CheSyn, cheilanthifoline
  synthase; StySyn, stylopine synthase; TNMT, tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase;
  MSH, methylstylopine hydroxylase; P6 H, protopine 6-hydroxylase; DBOX, dihydrobenzophenanthridine
  oxidase. StySyn and CheSyn cDNAs were functionally characterized in plant species
  other than opium poppy.'
