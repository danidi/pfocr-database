caption: 'NMNAT1 is a nuclear protein with a predicted nuclear localization signal
  (NLS) between Glu107–Lys146 []. NMNAT2 is localized to the Golgi apparatus via palmitoylation
  of Cys164 and Cys165 [, ]. In the mouse brain, NMNAT2 is enriched in numerous membrane
  compartments, including synaptic terminals and synaptic vesicles [, ]. NMNAT3 is
  predominantly localized in mitochondria and its first 25 residues encode a mitochondrial
  targeting sequence []. NAD+, the enzymatic product of NMNATs, is an essential cofactor
  for many metabolic processes, transcriptional regulation and several protein modification
  reactions. The NAD signaling pathway generates precursors of several intracellular
  calcium mobilizing agents including cADPR and NAADP. Abbreviations: ADPR, ADP-ribose;
  CAC, citric acid cycle; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; NADase, bifunctional NAD glycohydrolase/ADP-ribosylcyclase;
  PARP, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase.'
