caption: Angiogenic and vasculogenic mimicry promotion by CSCs is mainly triggered
  by VEGF among several types of cancer. There are different signaling pathways acting
  in order to promote and sustain neovascularization. 1. Angiogenesis promotion is
  leaded by TGFβ/ALK5 via VEGF expression in CSCs. 2. Wnt/β-catenin is activated by
  the interaction of VEGF-A/NRP-1 promoting tube formation. 3. CSCs are able to release
  VGEF-A by exosomes which in turn stimulates angiogenesis by miR-21/VEGF/VEGFR2 activation.
  4. Notch signaling conserves stemness and vasculogenic markers in glioblastoma.
  5. VEGFR2 through AKT/mTOR signaling pathway regulates transdifferentiation from
  poorly differentiated CRC cells into highly expressing CD31, CD34, and VE-cadherin
  ECs. 6. NF-κB/STAT3 pathway promotes tubule formation and angiogenesis on cancer
  stem-like cells via CCL5-CCR1/CCR3/CCR5. 7. VM can be influenced by DKK1 by EMT
  and CSCs behavior. 8. While FZD2 receptor can drive to EMT, thus enhancing stemness
  properties and VM capabilities.
