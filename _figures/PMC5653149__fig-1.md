caption: 'Matricellular protein families. The thrombospondin family in vertebrates
  consists of five members. TSP1 and TSP2 are trimeric proteins linked through disulfides
  in the coiled-coil region that follows the N-terminal HBDs. TSP1 and TSP2 contain
  three TSRs, which are absent in TSP3, TSP4, and COMP. The latter constitute a second
  subfamily of homopentamers linked through their coiled-coil regions. A HBD is absent
  in COMP. The SPARC family consists of SPARC, SPARC-like 1/Hevin, two SPARC-related
  modular calcium binding proteins (SMOC1 and SMOC2), follistatin-like 1, and three
  PARC/osteonectin, cwcv, and kazal-like domains proteoglycan proteins (SPOCK1–3).
  The follistatin and acidic domains are conserved among the family members, but the
  EF-hand of SPARC is not conserved. The CCN family consists of six members: CCN1,
  CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61); CCN2, CTGF; CCN3, NOV; CCN4, WISP1
  (WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1); CCN5, WISP2 (WNT1-inducible signaling
  pathway protein-2); and CCN6, WISP3 (WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-3).
  Tenascins are a family of hexameric proteins consisting of tenascin-C, tenascin-R,
  tenascin-X, and tenascin-W. The number of EGF-like repeats and fibronectin type
  3 repeats are variable. The ADAMTS family contains 19 members with variable number
  of TSRs. ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs;
  CCN, CYR61, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), and NOV (nephroblastoma overexpressed
  gene); COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; EF-hand, helix-loop-helix calcium-binding
  domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HBDs, heparin-binding domains; SPARC, secreted
  protein acidic and rich in cysteine; TSR, type 1 thrombospondin repeat. To see this
