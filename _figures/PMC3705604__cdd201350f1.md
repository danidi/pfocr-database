caption: Influence of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in death receptor signaling
  and function. In tumor cells, alterations of the components comprising the ‘glycosylation
  machinery' generate aberrant O-glycans and N-glycans on Fas and TRAIL receptors,
  which modulate apoptosis. Upregulation of GALNT3, FUT and GDP-FUC as a result of
  DNA methylation increases tumor cell sensitivity to extrinsic apoptosis through
  TRAIL. In addition, α2-6-linked sialic acid decorating Fas receptor on tumor cells
  blocks Fas ligand internalization, Fas–FADD complex formation and activation of
  caspase-8 and -3, thus attenuating cell death via the extrinsic pathway. Intracellular
  and extracellular galectins can modulate survival and apoptotic signaling pathways
  in tumor cells. Intracellular galectin-1 decreases Akt activity and induces apoptosis.
  By contrast, intracellular galectin-3 either free or associated with C2-ceramide
  cooperates with PI3K/Akt to increase tumor cell survival. However, in some cases,
  intracellular galectin-3 promotes extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis, either through
  association with Fas or via phosphorylation at serine 6. Extracellular galectin-3
  inhibits the extrinsic apoptosis cascade by anchoring TRAIL receptors through glycosylation-dependent
  mechanisms. Moreover, glycosylation of intracellular Fas ligands in tumor cells
  facilitates ligand secretion as a strategy of tumor-immune escape (a). Fas receptor
  on immune cell bears N-glycans to stabilize complexes like DISC, generated during
  the execution of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Increased α2-6 sialylation of
  N-glycans impairs Fas internalization, FADD–Fas complex formation, activation of
  caspase-8 and -3 and T-cell homeostasis. α2-6 sialylation further interferes with
  galectin-1 binding to glycoproteins (e.g. CD45, CD43), and also interrupts ligand
  binding to TNFR1 on macrophages and decreases apoptosis. Galectin-1 interacts with
  Fas on resting T cells and stimulates both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
  signaling routes (b). GALNT3, N-acetyl galactosyltransferase-3; FUT, fucosyltransferase;
  GDP-FUC, guanosine diphosphate-fucose; Akt, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase;
  Ser6, serine at position 6; CD45, protein tyrosine phosphatase; CD43; sialophorin
