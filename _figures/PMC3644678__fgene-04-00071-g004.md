caption: Feedback, compensatory, and feed-forward mechanisms in the longevity-modulating
  insulin signaling pathway. (A) Neuronally produced Drosophila insulin-like peptides
  exhibit feedback regulation among each other (Broughton et al., ; Grönke et al.,
  ). (B) The systemic activities of the Drosophila neuronal ilp2, ilp3, and ilp5 can
  be compensated by the systemic activity of the ilp6 produced from the head fat body
  (Grönke et al., ). (C) C. elegans ILP signaling between tissues (i.e., intestine
  to muscle or epidermis) involves feed-forward regulation via transcriptional inhibition
  of the ILP ins-7 (Murphy et al., ).
