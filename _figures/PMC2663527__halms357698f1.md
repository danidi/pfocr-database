caption: The formation of leukotrienes (LTs) through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of
  arachidonic acid metabolism, and the effects of LT inhibitors in different contexts.
  Gray ovals indicate the enzymes involved in LT biosynthesis; Phospholipase A2 (PLA2),
  5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) with its activating protein (FLAP), LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H),
  and LTC4 synthase (LTC4S). Rectangles indicate the LT receptors. Examples of LT
  synthesis inhibitors are indicated by black triangles, whereas examples of LT receptor
  antagonists are indicated by open triangles
