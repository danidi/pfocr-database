caption: Molecular mechanism through which high glucose (HG) concentration promotes
  proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. HG concentration activated
  pIGF1R and p-Src expression and increased downstream signaling by mediating the
  downregulation of miR-9 expression. Moreover, OSI-906 decreased the expression of
  the EMT protein N-cadherin and reduced the expression of the cell-cycle-regulated
  protein cyclin B1, as determined through Western blotting, but only cyclin B1 and
  E-cadherin were unchanged in SW620 cells (I). Similarly, PP1 decreased the expression
  of the EMT protein N-cadherin and reduced the expression of the cell-cycle-regulated
  protein cyclin B1, as determined through Western blotting (J), compared with the
  control group (dimethyl sulfoxide) cultured in HG-concentration medium. These data
  demonstrate that HG concentration promoted CRC cell proliferation, modulated EMT
  protein expression and morphology, and promoted cell migration and invasion ability
  through the IGF1R/Src/ERK pathway. In addition, miR-9-transfected cells expressed
  lower levels of p-IGF1R, cyclin B1, and N-cadherin, but E-cadherin was more upregulated
  compared with the negative control-transfected SW480 and SW620 cells, as determined
  through Western blotting. Thus, miR-9 is a tumor-suppressive microRNA that may regulate
  through the IGF1R/Src/ERK pathway the targeting of cyclin B1, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin
  in CRC cells in an HG-concentration environment (E).
