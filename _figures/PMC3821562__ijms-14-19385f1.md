caption: Schematic representation of the molecular signalling responsible for the
  differentiation-specific induction of Keratin 15 (K15) expression. Based on our
  previously published data we propose that K15, although normally a basal-specific
  keratin, can be induced in differentiating keratinocytes via Protein Kinase-C (PKC)/AP-1
  pathway. Differentiation-specific signals, such as loss of cell-surface β1 integrin
  receptors, increased cell-cell interactions or exposure to tumour-promoter phorbol
  esters, activate the endogenous PKC signalling, which results in activation of downstream
  transcription factors AP-1, which in turn induce K15 gene transcription. Blocking
  the activation of AP-1 by specific inhibitor, SR11302, or by dominant negative form
  of c-Jun, TAM67, inhibits the transcriptional induction of K15 [].
