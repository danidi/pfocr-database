caption: Layout and thermodynamics of the system. a Schematic representation of the
  arginine breakdown pathway. b Structures of arginine, citrulline and ornithine at
  neutral pH. c Thermodynamics of arginine conversion for the reactions of ArcA, ArcB,
  and ArcC1. G0 values were calculated for pH 7.0 and an ionic strength of 0.1 M using
  eQuilibrator 2.2. d Thermodynamics of the arginine/ornithine antiport reaction.
  G values were calculated at varying concentration gradients of arginine (outside
  to inside) and ornithine (inside to outside). When the arginine and ornithine gradients
  are opposite, that is, [Arg]in < [Arg]out and [Orn]in > [Orn]out, then a negative
  (and thus favorable) G value is obtained. Four scenarios for the product of the
  arginine and ornithine gradients are indicated
