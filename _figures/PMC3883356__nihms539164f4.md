caption: Activation of genes involved in SREBPs mediated cholesterol and fatty acid
  synthesis in cells exposed to PM for 4 days. Downstream target genes of either SREBP2
  (left) or SREBP1 (right) were listed in bold. The arrow ( ) indicated the up-regulation
  of mRNA levels, and number next to the arrow represented the average fold changes
  from duplicate microarray results.
