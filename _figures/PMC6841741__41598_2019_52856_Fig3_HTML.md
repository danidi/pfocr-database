caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the significantly altered miRNA found in the
  follicular fluid showing that 12 of these miRNA were related to the genes involved
  in the Inflammatory disease pathway. Strongly upregulated and downregulated miRNA
  are represented with dark red and green color and vice versa.
