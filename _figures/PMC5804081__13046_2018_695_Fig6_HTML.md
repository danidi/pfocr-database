caption: Line map of the potential mechanisms that FL3 inhibits UCB cell cycle progression
  and cells proliferation. FL3 blocks the interaction of Akt and PHB, which in turn
  inhibits the process of PHB phosphorylation by Akt and decreases the PHB localization
  within mitochondria, leading to inhibition of UCB cell proliferation. Meanwhile,
  FL3 treatment attenuates the control of PHB to GADD45α, which consequently activates
  the GADD45α-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G2/M. Taken together, FL3 inhibits
  the UCB cell proliferation
