caption: PalC two-hybrid interactions with ESCRT-III.A) PalC interacts with Vps32.
  The indicated GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and activation domain (AD) combinations
  were tested in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeY187 using the β-galactosidase filter lift
  assay. B) The indicated DBD and AD protein fusions were tested for two-hybrid interactions
  using quantitative β-galactosidase assays (given as enzyme units; SE, standard error).
  The reported PalA–Vps32 interaction is used here as a positive control. C) Network
  of PalC interactions tested in this work. The scheme summarizes data obtained using
  β-galactosidase quantitative () and filter lift (not shown) assays with S. cerevisiaeY187
  and the -Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade QSM system () with S. cerevisiaeAH109. Arrows and
  ‘T’ symbols denote positive and negative two-hybrid interactions for a given prey-to-bait
  combination, as indicated. Those combinations that are not indicated have not been
  tested (). Readers should note that while we have tested every possible two-hybrid
  combination between PalC and ESCRT-III proteins, we have not analysed interactions
  of all class E Vps proteins included in the diagram with one another. However, each
  of these ESCRT-III proteins has been validated (i.e. shown to give a positive interaction)
  with at least one partner in one orientation, and PalC is competent for interactions
  both as prey and as bait.
