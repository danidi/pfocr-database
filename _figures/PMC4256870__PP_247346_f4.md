caption: s of the vernalization pathway with edges (correlation between two genes)
  as known from the literature. Edge width indicates the strength of correlation.
  Red edges indicate correlations with r > 0.1, and blue edges indicate correlations
  with r < −0.1. A,  for genotype Columbia ( and ; expression data of FRI were set
  to 0 for , as FRI is nonfunctional in this genotype) at late collection time follows
  expectations from the literature. B,  for wild genotypes. Most edges follow expectations,
  except for the VIN3-AGL24 edge, where we find a negative correlation when a positive
  correlation would be expected (but compare with Supplemental Fig. S3). Another exception
  is MAF3, which interacts positively with both upstream VIN3 and downstream AGL20,
  when negative correlations would be expected for both. C,  for genotypes from low
  altitudes. Asterisks indicate that edges differed significantly from genotypes from
  high altitudes (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001). D,  for genotypes from
  high altitudes. Asterisks indicate that edges differed significantly from genotypes
  from low altitudes.
