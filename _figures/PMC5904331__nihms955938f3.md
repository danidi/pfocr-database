caption: Modifier pathways that influence FA disease progression that are discussed
  in this review. Aldehydes act as a source of endogenous ICLs. In the context of
  an impaired FA pathway, overcoming the ability of aldehyde detoxifying enzymes to
  metabolize aldehydes results in the accumulation of ICLs that exacerbate disease
  progression. Hyperactive TGFβ signaling perturbs DNA repair mechanisms in a manner
  that further weakens ICL repair in FA cells. Drugs, or classes of drugs, that target
  specific components of the discussed modifier pathways are shown in red.
