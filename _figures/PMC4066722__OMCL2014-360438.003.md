caption: 'MDA formation and metabolism. MDA can be generated in vivo by decomposition
  of arachidonic acid (AA) and larger PUFAs as a side product by enzymatic processes
  during the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic
  acid (HHT) (blue pathway), or through nonenzymatic processes by bicyclic endoperoxides
  produced during lipid peroxidation (red pathway). One formed MDA can be enzymatically
  metabolized (green pathway). Key enzymes involved in the formation and metabolism
  of MDA: cyclooxygenases (1), prostacyclin hydroperoxidase (2), thromboxane synthase
  (3), aldehyde dehydrogenase (4), decarboxylase (5), acetyl CoA synthase (6), and
  tricarboxylic acid cycle (7).'
