caption: A working hypothesis of IRS-mediated control of protein synthesis. Following
  IGF stimulation, intracellular signaling through IRS activates downstream PI3K–mTOR
  signaling pathway, which is well known to promote translation of mRNAs. Up-regulation
  of protein synthesis is supported by ribosome maturation, which is accomplished
  by multiple coordinated processes, including rRNA transcription and ribosome activation
  (e.g., ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation). The transcribed rRNAs in nucleus undergo
  chemical modification by snoRNP complexes whose biogenesis is controlled by nuclear
  IRS-1.
