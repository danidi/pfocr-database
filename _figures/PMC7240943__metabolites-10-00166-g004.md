caption: 'Scheme of coenzyme A synthesis. The coenzyme A synthesis pathway is shadowed
  in blue. panK (also named as coaA) was the committed step for coenzyme synthesis,
  which is proposed to be expressed to increase both coenzyme A and acetyl-CoA concentration.
  Dashed arrows indicate multi-step reactions. Abbreviation: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.'
