caption: Schematic picture of possible interference mechanisms of klohto with insulin
  signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 differentiated cells. The exact interconnection points
  of klotho with insulin receptor or intracellular signaling mediators have not been
  elucidated; however, our results indicated inhibitory effects of klotho on Akt,
  GSK3β, and PFK-3β phosphorylation. These factors are involved in the adipocytes
  metabolism and survival and it appears that klotho affects most of this processes.
  Akt, protein kinase B; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4.
