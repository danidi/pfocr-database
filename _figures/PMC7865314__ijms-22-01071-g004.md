caption: 'Optimising radiation dose and delivery for optimal immunogenicity. Small
  doses of radiation delivered in conventional fractionated radiotherapy are believed
  to have immunosuppressive effects in the tumour microenvironment; accumulation of
  immunosuppressive cell types such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory
  T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages repress anti-tumour immunity. This immunosuppressive
  effect is somewhat counterbalanced by the normalising effect low dose radiation
  has on the tumour vasculature. Higher doses of radiation, such as those used in
  hypofractionation, can have a stimulatory immunogenic effect mediated by increased
  antigen presenting cell (APC) maturation, in addition to augmented T cell infiltration
  and enhanced expression of immunogenic proteins including MHC class I, ICAM and
  FAS on tumour cells. However, once the dose of radiation surpasses 12–18 Gy, immunogenicity
  is compromised: TREX1, an exonuclease, is induced leading to degradation of cytoplasmic
  DNA, thus negatively regulating the cGAS-STING pathway.'
