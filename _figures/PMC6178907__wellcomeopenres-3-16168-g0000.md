caption: Cellular response to low oxygen as mediated through HIFs and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenases signalling. HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylases 1-3 (PHD1-3)
  under normoxic conditions and targets the protein for proteasomal degradation by
  the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Under hypoxia, PHDs are
  no longer active, allowing s HIF-1α translocation to the nucleus where it heterodimerises
  with HIF-1β. This heterodimer recognizes and binds to the hypoxia responsive element
  (HRE), recruits p300 and activates its target genes. The HIF-independent pathway
  involves the oxygen-dependent dioxygenases. TETs promote the conversion of 5-methylcytosine
  to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to achieve demethylation. Under hypoxia, it is thought
  that TETs promote DNA hypermethylation through a decrease in its activity due to
  oxygen shortage, resulting in the accumulation of 5-methylcytosine and DNA hypermethylation
  in tumours.
