caption: S1PR2 activation by conjugated bile acids activates the ERK 1/2 and AKT signaling
  pathways and expression of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) in the nuclei of liver hepatocytes.
  SphK2 produces S1P to inhibit histone deacetylases 1 and 2 with up-regulation of
  expression of the genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of sterols and
  lipids. SphK2 activation also activates AKT in a non-insulin-dependent manner. Activation
  of the insulin signaling pathway is required for optimal activation of FXR and SHP
  induction, which represses expression of the genes involved in the metabolism of
  sterols and lipids.
