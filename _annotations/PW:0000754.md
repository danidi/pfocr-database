definition: "The pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics pathway elicited by the administration of specific drugs. The systems involved in drug processing and responses are also those handling exogenous, xenobiotic compounds in the cellular detoxification pathway. The distinction between a random encounter with a foreign compound and the processing of a substance administered for treatment along with the importance of genetic variation for the individual responses to particular drugs warrant their separate consideration."
